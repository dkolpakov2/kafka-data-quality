# The external address of the host on which the JobManager runs and can be
# reached by the TaskManagers and any clients which want to connect. This setting
# is only used in Standalone mode and may be overwritten on the JobManager side
# by specifying the --host <hostname> parameter of the bin/jobmanager.sh executable.
# In high availability mode, if you use the bin/start-cluster.sh script and setup
# the conf/masters file, this will be taken care of automatically. Yarn
# automatically configure the host name based on the hostname of the node where the
# JobManager runs.

jobmanager.rpc.address: jobmanager

# The RPC port where the JobManager is reachable.

jobmanager.rpc.port: 6123

# The host interface the JobManager will bind to. By default, this is localhost, and will prevent
# the JobManager from communicating outside the machine/container it is running on.
# On YARN this setting will be ignored if it is set to 'localhost', defaulting to 0.0.0.0.
# On Kubernetes this setting will be ignored, defaulting to 0.0.0.0.
#
# To enable this, set the bind-host address to one that has access to an outside facing network
# interface, such as 0.0.0.0.

jobmanager.bind-host: 0.0.0.0


# The total process memory size for the JobManager.
#
# Note this accounts for all memory usage within the JobManager process, including JVM metaspace and other overhead.

jobmanager.memory.process.size: 1600m

# The host interface the TaskManager will bind to. By default, this is localhost, and will prevent
# the TaskManager from communicating outside the machine/container it is running on.

# To enable this, set the bind-host address to one that has access to an outside facing network

taskmanager.bind-host: 0.0.0.0

# The address of the host on which the TaskManager runs and can be reached by the JobManager and
# other TaskManagers. If not specified, the TaskManager will try different strategies to identify
# the address.
#
# Note this address needs to be reachable by the JobManager and forward traffic to one of
# the interfaces the TaskManager is bound to (see 'taskmanager.bind-host').
#
# Note also that unless all TaskManagers are running on the same machine, this address needs to be
# configured separately for each TaskManager.


# The total process memory size for the TaskManager.
#
# Note this accounts for all memory usage within the TaskManager process, including JVM metaspace and other overhead.

taskmanager.memory.process.size: 1728m

# To exclude JVM metaspace and overhead, please, use total Flink memory size instead of 'taskmanager.memory.process.size'.
# It is not recommended to set both 'taskmanager.memory.process.size' and Flink memory.
#
# taskmanager.memory.flink.size: 1280m

# The number of task slots that each TaskManager offers. Each slot runs one parallel pipeline.

taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 1

# The parallelism used for programs that did not specify and other parallelism.

parallelism.default: 1

# The default file system scheme and authority.
# 
# By default file paths without scheme are interpreted relative to the local
# root file system 'file:///'. Use this to override the default and interpret
# relative paths relative to a different file system,
# for example 'hdfs://mynamenode:12345'
#
# fs.default-scheme

#==============================================================================
# High Availability
#==============================================================================

# The high-availability mode. Possible options are 'NONE' or 'zookeeper'.
#
# high-availability.type: zookeeper

# The path where metadata for master recovery is persisted. While ZooKeeper stores
# the small ground truth for checkpoint and leader election, this location stores
# the larger objects, like persisted dataflow graphs.
# 
# Must be a durable file system that is accessible from all nodes
# (like HDFS, S3, Ceph, nfs, ...) 
#
# high-availability.storageDir: hdfs:///flink/ha/

# The list of ZooKeeper quorum peers that coordinate the high-availability
# setup. This must be a list of the form:
# "host1:clientPort,host2:clientPort,..." (default clientPort: 2181)
#
# high-availability.zookeeper.quorum: localhost:2181


# ACL options are based on https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_BuiltinACLSchemes
# It can be either "creator" (ZOO_CREATE_ALL_ACL) or "open" (ZOO_OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE)
# The default value is "open" and it can be changed to "creator" if ZK security is enabled
#
# high-availability.zookeeper.client.acl: open

#==============================================================================
# Fault tolerance and checkpointing
#==============================================================================

# The backend that will be used to store operator state checkpoints if
# checkpointing is enabled. Checkpointing is enabled when execution.checkpointing.interval > 0.
#
# Execution checkpointing related parameters. Please refer to CheckpointConfig and ExecutionCheckpointingOptions for more details.
#
# execution.checkpointing.interval: 3min
# execution.checkpointing.externalized-checkpoint-retention: [DELETE_ON_CANCELLATION, RETAIN_ON_CANCELLATION]

# Supported backends are 'hashmap', 'rocksdb', or the
# <class-name-of-factory>.

# state.backend.type: hashmap

# Directory for checkpoints filesystem, when using any of the default bundled
# state backends.

# state.checkpoints.dir: hdfs://namenode-host:port/flink-checkpoints

# Default target directory for savepoints, optional.
#
# state.savepoints.dir: hdfs://namenode-host:port/flink-savepoints

# Flag to enable/disable incremental checkpoints for backends that
# support incremental checkpoints (like the RocksDB state backend). 
#
# state.backend.incremental: false

# The failover strategy, i.e., how the job computation recovers from task failures.
# Only restart tasks that may have been affected by the task failure, which typically includes
# downstream tasks and potentially upstream tasks if their produced data is no longer available for consumption.

jobmanager.execution.failover-strategy: region

# The port to which the REST client connects to. If rest.bind-port has
# not been specified, then the server will bind to this port as well.
